# JustGo-Boulder

Our project is a website that gives a look into Boulder from locals' perspective. It gives users a list of attractions from four different categories. This software is unique from other websites because it combines different types of attraction in one place. 
Each attraction page has pictures, prices, contact info, prices, the weather for that day, etc. To give users an easy experience to gather all information to visit the desired attraction.
