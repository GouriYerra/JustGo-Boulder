        <h1>Dining</h1>
        <p>From the heart of America's Foodiest City, Downtown Boulder offers over 100 dining options, from casual & contemporary to exotic  & ethnic  and everything in between.
            With a world-class farmers market at their disposal, downtown chefs are leading the charge of organic, sustainable and best of all, delicious cuisine! </p>

        <h2 text-align:"center" >Pearl Street</h2>
        <p>While sometimes envisioned as a sleep town, Boulder is abuzz with culinary energy. There's more that one hub of restaurant activity, too, though there's no better
            place to start than Pearl Street, the pedestrian thoroughfare at the center of the city. For those who think Boulder has nothing to offer the foodies among us,
            be sure to try these 10 top Pearl Street restaurants. We promise you won't leave hungry (or unsatisfied).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pasta Jay's: Hearty, homestyle Italian-American dishes star at this popular rustic restaurant open since 1988.</li>
          <li>Bar Taco: Boasting a rustic but modern setting on West Pearl, the Boulder branch is the first Colorado location for an outfit that has 15
              locations, mostly on the East Coast. It's a bustling spot with a high-energy vibe, and certainly does little to detract from Boulder's reputation
              as a hip college town.</li>
          <li>Illegal Pete's: Illegal Pete's is a Colorado-based group of quick-service "Mission Style" burrito restaurants that takes inspiration from burritos popularized
              in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s.</li>

        </ul>

          <h2  style = "padding: 10px">The Hill</h2>
          <p>Just across Broadway, you'll find The Hill, blocks of funky shops, bookstores, cafes and restaurants. Grab a cup of coffee at Innisfree Poetry Bookstore and Cafe, stop in for a slice of
            pizza at The Sink (where a young Robert Redford was once a bus boy) or nosh on upscale farm-to-table tapas at Cafe Aion. If you're around in the evening, catch a show at The Fox Theatre on 13th Street
             for the full Hill experience. Global dining is also available on campus at the Center for Community, an award-winning dining center offering cuisine from 10 micro-restaurants representing different world cultures. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Sink: some of the best burgers and pizzas around, but not just known as one of the best places to visit because of the food.

Open Daily from 11AM-2AM, with a special late night menu from 10PM-1AM! Need a late night snack? The Sink serves up wings, slider, reubens, mac-n-cheese, chicken tenders, green chili fries and more!</li>
