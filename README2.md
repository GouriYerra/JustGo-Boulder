The structure of our repository, the first directory is called"Front End" and it contains all of the images that are in the website. 
The files names "milestones" this includes all of the milestone files that we have submitted in the past 
"admin" directory contains the source code for the features that the admins are allowed to perform, such as add/delete attractions. 
the rest of the html files are the tabs that are in our website. 

there are two README files the first one gives an intriduction about our project and the second one is this one. 

teh sql file called emptyDB is mysql code that contains the design of our database. but it is not populated. 

users will be able to download all of the HTML files and run the web page. 
"testData.sql" is a file that contains the test cases used to make sure of the suntionality of our database. 
We did not apply continious intergration in our project, as our testing came towards the end. and because there are five group memeber 
working on different segments of the code, using CI would have caused problems when pushing at the same time
